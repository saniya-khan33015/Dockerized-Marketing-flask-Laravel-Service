# 🐳 **Dockerized Marketing Management Service using Python Flask**

---

## 🎯 **Problem Statement**

The objective of this project is to containerize a Marketing Management Service built using **Python and Flask** by following industry best practices for Docker.

The project focuses on creating optimized **multi-stage Dockerfiles** to reduce image size, enhance security, and improve deployment efficiency. It also includes configuring **Docker Compose** to orchestrate the Flask application along with its MySQL database.

This ensures a consistent, portable, and production-ready development and deployment environment across the entire team.

---

## 📖 **Description**

This project demonstrates how a Python Flask-based Marketing Management System can be transformed into a fully containerized application using Docker.

By packaging the application and its dependencies into containers, environment-related issues are eliminated. The system runs consistently across development, testing, and production environments.

Docker Compose is used to manage multiple services such as:

- **Flask Application**
- **MySQL Database**

This setup ensures smooth communication between services within an isolated Docker network.

## 🎯 **Objectives**

- Containerize the Python Flask application using Docker  
- Create optimized multi-stage Dockerfiles  
- Configure Docker Compose for multi-service management  
- Ensure consistent development and production environments  
- Improve deployment efficiency and portability  
- Enable easy scaling and maintenance
